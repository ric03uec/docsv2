# Container Services integration

Shippable Deploy lets you easily deploy your Dockerized applications to popular Container Services like Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS), Google Container Engine (GKE), or Red Hat OpenShift 3.

You will first need to configure an account integration with your credentials and/or keys in order to interact with these services using Shippable Deploy.

## Amazon EC2 Container Service Using Account Keys

To deploy applications to Amazon ECS, you need to configure an AWS account integration with credentials to access the ECS instance.

1. From your [Shippable dashboard](https://app.shippable.com), Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the `Integrations` tab. Click on 'Add Integration'
2. **Integration type:** In the dropdown, select `AWS`
3. **Integration Name:** Use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: `manishas-aws-ecs`
4. Enter your access and secret keys provided by AWS. [See here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html) for info on how to generate them.
5. Click `Save`

You can now use this integration to set up your Environment and Deployment Pipelines on your ECS clusters. For more information on this, please check out our [Deployment pipelines section](pipelines_overview.md)

## Amazon EC2 Container Service using Cross Account IAM Roles

This is another(recommended) way of giving AWS account access to Shippable without sharing your AWS Secret and Access Keys. [AWS Cross Account account IAM Roles documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) provides technical details on how Shippable internall implements this. To put simply, Shippable uses its own AWS account keys to assume a Role on user's behalf and then perform actions on user's AWS account.

This requires four additional steps to be performed by the user

#### Create a Role that Shippable will assume:
-----
  on IAM console do following  
  **New Role** ->  
  Role Name: `shippable-role-to-allow-ecs-access` ->  
  **Role for Cross Account Access** ->  
  **Allows IAM users from a 3rd party AWS account to access this account.** ->  
  **Account Id**: < shippable aws account id >, **External Id**: < users shippable account id > ->  
  **Next Step** ->  
  **Create Role**  

#### Add policy to role to access ECS entities:  
-----
   select the role `shippable-role-to-allow-ecs-access`  
  **Permissions** ->  
  **Inline Policies** ->  
  **Custom Policy**. Name the policy as `shippable-policy-to-access-ecs` and add following policy document  

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterInstancesFromLoadBalancer",
                "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer",
                "elasticloadbalancing:ConfigureHealthCheck",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DeleteLoadBalancerListeners",
                "elasticloadbalancing:CreateLoadBalancerListeners",
                "iam:ListServerCertificates",
                "iam:ListRoles",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ecs:DescribeClusters",
                "ecs:ListClusters",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:ListTaskDefinitions",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:DeleteService",
                "ecs:CreateService",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:ListContainerInstances",
                "ecs:DescribeContainerInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Update the `Trust Relationship` of the Role
  navigate to the Role `shippable-role-to-allow-ecs-access` from IAM console ->  
  **Edit Trust Relationship** ->  
  Add the following entity to the `Statement` array of the Policy Document
```
{
    "Sid": "",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "ecs.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}

```

  The complete Policy Document should look something like this

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<shippable aws account id> :root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "<users shippable account id>"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ecs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
  click **Update Trust Policy**


#### Configure Shippable to use this role to access the account

  1. From your [Shippable dashboard](https://app.shipable.com), Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the `Integrations` tab. Click on 'Add Integration'
  2. **Integration type:** In the dropdown, select `AWS (IAM)`
  3. **Integration Name:** Use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: `manishas-aws-iam`
  4. Enter the ARN for the role `shippable-role-to-allow-ecs-access`. This will be a string with format like this `arn:aws:iam::12345678912:role/shippable-role-to-allow-ecs-access`
  5. Click `Save`

You can now use this integration to set up your Environment and Deployment Pipelines on your ECS clusters. For more information on this, please check out our [Deployment pipelines section](pipelines_overview.md)

## Google Container Engine (GKE)

To deploy applications to GKE, you need to configure an account integration with credentials to access your GKE account.

* Go to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console. Create a new Service account by following the instructions in Google's documentation for [Generating a service account credential](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts) and generate a private key in JSON format.
* Copy the JSON key you generated for your Service account.  
* Sign in to Shippable and go to your [Account Settings](https://app.shippable.com/accountSettings). Click on the `Integrations` tab.
* Click on `Add Integration`. Choose `Google Container Engine`, name your integration, and paste your JSON key.
* Click `Save`

You can now use this integration to set up your Environment and Deployment Pipelines on your GKE clusters. For more information on this, please check out our [Deployment pipelines section](pipelines_overview.md)
